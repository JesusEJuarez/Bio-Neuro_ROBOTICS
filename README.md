## Neuro-Robotics Projects
### Path planing
The path planning of a robot is an important aspect because for two given points A and B in space, the robot can reach them through different paths. However, some of these paths may be too complex, time-consuming, or the robot may not be able to traverse certain paths due to its geometry. Hence, it is important to explore methods that allow generating routes as efficiently as possible and ensure that the robot is capable of executing them.
In this section, you will find some path planning algorithms for a 3-degree-of-freedom robot. The workspace for each algorithm could be changed.
